# Lip6-Moodle-LRS
This repository contains the template for consolidating Moodle log data. It is based on the integration of logs extracted directly from your Moodle site and data extracted from the connected database.

## Quick start
### Collect your data
You first need to collect logs and database data:

- platform logs from [Moodle log generation interface](https://your_moodle_site/report/log/index.php?id=0)
(replace *your_moodle_site* with the address of your site). Please be aware that the *Manager* role is a minimum requirement to access the logs.
- database data
- course shortnames
- user roles

Export all files into *CSV* format.

### Queries
To access the database, you can install the [Configurable reports](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_configurable_reports) plugin. 
The following queries can be used to retrieve data from Moodle database.
#### Database data
```SQL
SELECT id, userid, courseid, relateduserid, timecreated
FROM mdl_logstore_standard_log
```
#### Course shortname
```SQL
SELECT id, shortname
FROM mdl_course
```
#### User roles
Query for student (role = 5), teacher (role = 3), and non-editing teacher (role = 4):
```SQL
SELECT cx.instanceid as courseid, u.id as userid
FROM mdl_course c LEFT OUTER JOIN mdl_context cx ON c.id = cx.instanceid
LEFT OUTER JOIN mdl_role_assignments ra ON cx.id = ra.contextid AND ra.roleid = '???' AND cx.instanceid <> 1
LEFT OUTER JOIN mdl_user u ON ra.userid = u.id Where cx.contextlevel = '50'
```
Query for manager (role = 1) and course creator (role = 2):
```SQL
SELECT distinct userid
FROM mdl_role_assignments
WHERE roleid = '???'
```

Query for admin role:
```SQL
SELECT value
FROM mdl_config
WHERE name = 'siteadmins'
```

A complete list of roles is available in [Site administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles](https://your_moodle_site/admin/roles/manage.php) (replace *your_moodle_site* with the address of your site). Please be aware that the *Manager* role is a minimum requirement to access the roles.
To add new roles, you can integrate the function *add_role* in `src/algorithms/integrating.py`.

#### Deleted users
You may choose to purge records of deleted users. Get the list of deleted users' id from the database.

Query for deleted users:
```SQL
SELECT id
FROM mdl_user
WHERE deleted = 1
```

### Access your data
Place all *CSV* files in `src/datasets`. 
Replace paths in `src/paths.py`. 

### Get your consolidated data
Run `main.py`.

According to your needs, you can modify *get_consolidated_data* function call.
If you want to get more fields, modify the variable *columns*.


## Get course data
Once the data has been consolidated, you can extract data from specific courses.

### Get specific data
You have first to create the object *Records* to use its methods. 
Then, to extract specific data, you can specify the following parameters: 'year', 'course_area', 'role', 'username'. 
Note that you may choose more than one entry, and that each entry must be provided as a list.
The entire dataset is returned if you make no selections.

You can also specify the 'dates_path'  containing the course dates to remove values that don't fall within the start and 
end dates.
You can get start and end dates by querying the database:
```SQL
SELECT shortname, startdate, enddate 
FROM mdl_course
where id <> 1
```

### Clean the dataset
You can either clean the entire dataset or each course individually by modifying the function *clean_records* in
`src/algorithms/cleaning.py` according to your specific needs.

```SQL
records = cl.clean_records(records)
or
course_A = cl.clean_records(course_A)
```
### Example

```bash
from src.classes.records import Records
import src.algorithms.cleaning as cl
import src.algorithms.extracting as ex
import pandas as pd
from src.paths import course_dates_path

# ------------
# GET DATA
# ------------
# get the consolidated dataframe
df_path = 'datasets/df_consolidated.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(df_path)

# create a Records object to use its methods
records = Records(df)

# ----------------------
# GET COURSES TO ANALYSE
# ----------------------
# select specific attributes to get the desired values
course_A = ex.extract_records(records, course_area=['Course A'], role=['Student'], course_dates=course_dates_path)
course_B = ex.extract_records(records, year=[2021], username=['Student 01'])

# -----------------
# CLEAN THE DATASET
# -----------------
# you can either clean the entire dataset or each course individually
# records = cl.clean_specific_records(records)
course_A = cl.clean_specific_records(course_A)
```
